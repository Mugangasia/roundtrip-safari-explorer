    longDescription: "The Maasai Mara National Reserve is one of Africa's most magnificent game reserves. Bordering Tanzania, the Mara is the northern extension of the Serengeti and forms a wildlife corridor between the two countries. It's named after the statuesque, red-cloaked Maasai people who live in the park and graze their animals there as they have done for centuries. In addition to the big cats, the Mara is known for its annual Great Migration, when thousands of wildebeest, zebra, and Thomson's gazelle travel to and from the Serengeti in Tanzania from July through October.",
